Tell they have to step it up and get it bigger
Got to get a dope boy, get them grams off quicker

Yachty

ISpy

She said she 21 I might have to I.D. that
All my bitches come in pairs like balls in my nutsack
I remember ridin around the city in a Hatchback
Lookin for a problem with my young goblins
Ima send a model home with her neck throbbin
I done made so much money that its non-stoppin
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin everyone I couldnt be tamed
Woah six months later I had snapped and now Im in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from "Can you take me here?" to screening out the lane
Went from "Damn this nigga lame" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who aint fucked with me
They went to college now all them niggas is history
Upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Riding deep in the van like we lookin for a mystery Raggy!
So dont fuck with me
No lately I been livin like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mothers mother I wont fuck a bitch without a damn rubber

Broccoli

Hey lil mama would you like to be my sunshine?
Nigga touch my gang we gon turn this shit to Columbine
Ice on my neck cost me ten times three
Thirty thousand dollars for a nigga to get flee
I just hit Rodéo and I spent like ten Gs
I just did a show and spent the check on my mama
When I go on vacay I might rent out the Bahamas
And I keep like ten phones damn Im really never home
All these niggas clones tryna copy what Im on
Nigga get your own tryna pick a nigga bone
Word to brother Skip boy I had a good day
Metro PCS trappin boy Im makin plays
Fifty shades of grey beat that pussy like Hulk Hogan
I know you know my slogan if it aint bout guap Im gone
Niggas hatin cause Im chosen from the concrete I had rose
Shawty starin at my necklace cause my diamonds really froze
Put that dick up in her pussy bet she feel it in her toes
Im a real young nigga from the six throwin bows
Im a real young nigga from the six throwin bows
Real young nigga from the six throwin bows

XXL Cypher

That boy not gang no that boy not my friend
I hang with my gang the same gang that felt all of my pain
When I was struggling through the rain
When I had no guap with no ice
Wasn’t no food but rice
All of these bitches they want me but they get 1Night
Fuck ‘em I give a fuck what you sayin’
Bitch nigga know I ain’t playing

Chance Mixtape

Am I the only one who really care about cover art?
Growing up I aint have my brother
Cause he said the streets gave him a fresh start
I aint know what that mean
I bumped heads with my dean
Dropped out and hit the scene
Now Im stunting like bling
Time and time again they told me no
They told me I wouldnt go
Cause in high school all I cared about was hoes
Well maybe that shit was my interest
Now I spend more than they make at my dentist
After 1Night the folks thought I was finished
I pinned my name to the game like a seamstress
Oh bitch I bite like a gator
Fuck them reviews that they put in the paper
Did what I wanted didnt care about a hater
Delivered my tape to the world as a caterer
Oh they fuck with me cause Im different
New sound new appearance
Bitch its Boat from the 6
Give a fuck about a bitch
Walk out my hand on my dick Im the shit

How you do it? Only God know
I want to know whos real until the time fold
People looking at Lil Boat with their hands out cause Im wearing nicer clothes
Imma stay down with the same niggas I came up with thats the master plan
26 for a nigga hand diamonds so cold you might need a fan
I dont know who I am sometimes
I might rap a verse I might sing a song
Came up overnight from one song
One night get her out the thong
Old heads hating on Boat
Cause Im young as fuck and Im rich as hell
Pants low like Im fresh in jail
